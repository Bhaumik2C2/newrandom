                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Neer Patel, a 3rd-year Computer Science major who loves coding and problem-solving. Currently, I work as a Resident Assistant in Crowell Tower, where I try to make the community a welcoming and supportive place for residents. I find the study of data structures and algorithms extremely interesting. I enjoy learning how algorithms work under the hood and finding ways to implement them to solve real-world problems. I also really love my software engineering course, since it's giving me a glimpse into how software is developed in the real world—something I find incredibly exciting.</p>
            <p>Apart from my studies, I am into activities that keep me active and make the most of my free time. My first choice among sports is soccer; it combines strategy with teamwork perfectly. Another favorite sport of mine is badminton; there is a certain satisfaction associated with the fast reflexes required in this game and the competitive spirit that it arouses. On days when I do not feel like doing sports, you will find me at the gym. Working out keeps me focused and gives me energy, both mentally and physically.</p>
            <p>I'm taking this course because I want to expand my knowledge and practical experience in full-stack web development. With my background in software engineering, I see this as the perfect opportunity to gain hands-on skills in backend technologies, databases, and modern frameworks. The ability to build complete, dynamic web applications excites me, and this course will help me bring those ideas to life.</p>
            <h3>What I Want to Learn</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full-stack web development with AMP, MEVN, MEAN, and MERN stacks.</li>
                    <li>Backend technologies, including NodeJS, PHP, and Python with Flask.</li>
                    <li>Databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Postgres.</li>
                    <li>Cloud services, IoT, and modern web standards.</li>
                    <li>Building dynamic web apps with frameworks like VueJS and JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My Expectations from This Course</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gain hands-on experience in both backend and frontend web technologies.</li>
                    <li>Learn to build full-stack apps, starting from traditional AMP stack to modern frameworks.</li>
                    <li>Develop skills in API creation, database integration, and web security.</li>
                    <li>Work on a final project to demonstrate full-stack web development ability.</li>
                </ul>
